# CWStatusBarNotification

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cezarywojcik/CWStatusBarNotification.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cezarywojcik/CWStatusBarNotification)

**NOTE:** You can find a `Swift` implementation of this library [in the swift branch of this repo](https://github.com/cezarywojcik/CWStatusBarNotification/tree/swift).

`CWStatusBarNotification` is a library that allows you to easily create text-based notifications that appear on the status bar.

## Requirements

`CWStatusBarNotification` uses ARC and requires iOS 7.0+.

Works for iPhone and iPad.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

`pod 'CWStatusBarNotification', '~> 2.1.3'`

### Manual

Copy the folder `CWStatusBarNotification` to your project.

## Usage

***Note:** The previous version of this library implemented the notifications using a category. This version uses an object instead.*

Firstly, you need the following import statement:

```
#import "CWStatusBarNotification.h"
```

Now, you need to create a `CWStatusBarNotification` object. It is recommended that you do so by attaching it as a property to a `UIViewController`.

```
CWStatusBarNotification *notification = [CWStatusBarNotification new];
```
After you have a `CWStatusBarNotification` object, you can simply call the `displayNotificationMessage:forDuration:` method:

```
[self.notification displayNotificationWithMessage:@"Hello, World!"
                   forDuration:1.0f];
```

If you prefer to manually choose when to display and dismiss the notification, you can do so as well:

```
[self.notification displayNotificationWithMessage:@"Hello" completion:nil];
// wait until you need to dismiss
[self.notification dismissNotification];
```

### Behavior on Tap

The default behavior when the notification is tapped is to dismiss it. However, you can override this behavior by setting the `onTapNotification` block to something different. 

For example:

```
self.notification.notificationTappedBlock = ^(void) {
    NSLog(@"notification tapped");
    // more code here
};

```

Note that overriding this block means that the notification will no longer be dismissed when tapped. If you want the notification to still dismiss when tapped, make sure to implement the following when overriding the block:

```
__weak typeof(self) weakSelf = self;
self.notification.notificationTappedBlock = ^(void) {
    if (!weakSelf.notificationIsDismissing) {
        [weakSelf dismissNotification];
        // more code here
    }
};
```

## Customizing Appearance

First of all, you can customize the background color and text color using the following properties: `notificationLabelBackgroundColor` and `notificationLabelTextColor`.

Example:

```
notification.notificationLabelBackgroundColor = [UIColor blackColor];
notification.notificationLabelTextColor = [UIColor greenColor];
```

The default value of `notificationLabelBackgroundColor` is `[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate].window.tintColor`.

The default value of `notification.notificationLabelTextColor` is `[UIColor whiteColor]`.

Finally, you can also choose from two styles - a notification the size of the status bar, or a notification the size of the status bar and a navigation bar. Simply change the `notificationStyle` property of the `CWStatusBarNotification` object to either `CWNotificationStyleStatusBarNotification` or `CWNotificationStyleNavigationBarNotification`.

The default value of `notificationStyle` is `CWNotificationStyleStatusBarNotification`.

## Customizing Animation

There are two properties that determine the animation style of the notification: `notificationAnimationInStyle` and `notificationAnimationOutStyle`. Each can take on one of four values:

* `CWNotificationAnimationStyleTop`
* `CWNotificationAnimationStyleBottom`
* `CWNotificationAnimationStyleLeft`
* `CWNotificationAnimationStyleRight`

The `notificationAnimationInStyle` describes where the notification comes from, whereas the `notificationAnimationOutStyle` describes where the notification will go.

The default value for `notificationAnimationInStyle` is `CWNotificationAnimationStyleTop`.

The default value for `notificationAnimationOutStyle` is `CWNotificationAnimationStyleTop`.

### Additional Remarks

The notifications will work in both screen orientations, however, screen rotation while a notification is displayed is not yet fully supported.
