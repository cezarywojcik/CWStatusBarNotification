# CWStatusBarNotification

`CWStatusBarNotification` is a library that allows you to easily create text-based notifications that appear on the status bar.

## Requirements

`CWStatusBarNotification` uses ARC and requires iOS 7.0+.

Works for iPhone and iPad.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

`pod 'CWStatusBarNotification', '~> 3.0'`

### Manual

Copy the folder `CWStatusBarNotification` to your project.

## Usage

***Note:** The previous version of this library implemented the notifications using a category. This version uses an object instead.*

Firstly, you need the following import statement:

```
#import "CWStatusBarNotification.h"
```

Now, you need to create a `CWStatusBarNotification` object. It is recommended that you do so by attaching it as a property to a `UIViewController`.

```
CWStatusBarNotification *notification = [CWStatusBarNotification new];
```
After you have a `CWStatusBarNotification` object, you can simply call the `displayNotificationMessage:forDuration:` method:

```
[self.notification displayNotificationWithMessage:@"Hello, World!"
                   forDuration:1.0f];
```

If you prefer to manually choose when to display and dismiss the notification, you can do so as well:

```
[self.notification displayNotificationWithMessage:@"Hello" completion:nil];
// wait until you need to dismiss
[self.notification dismissNotification];
```

## Customizing Appearance

First of all, you can customize the background color and text color using the following properties: `notificationLabelBackgroundColor` and `notificationLabelTextColor`.

Example:

```
notification.notificationLabelBackgroundColor = [UIColor blackColor];
notification.notificationLabelTextColor = [UIColor greenColor];
```

The default value of `notificationLabelBackgroundColor` is `[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate].window.tintColor`.

The default value of `notification.notificationLabelTextColor` is `[UIColor whiteColor]`.

Finally, you can also choose from two styles - a notification the size of the status bar, or a notification the size of the status bar and a navigation bar. Simply change the `notificationStyle` property of the `CWStatusBarNotification` object to either `CWNotificationStyleStatusBarNotification` or `CWNotificationStyleNavigationBarNotification`.

The default value of `notificationStyle` is `CWNotificationStyleStatusBarNotification`.

## Customizing Animation

There are two properties that determine the animation style of the notification: `notificationAnimationInStyle` and `notificationAnimationOutStyle`. Each can take on one of four values:

* `CWNotificationAnimationStyleTop`
* `CWNotificationAnimationStyleBottom`
* `CWNotificationAnimationStyleLeft`
* `CWNotificationAnimationStyleRight`

The `notificationAnimationInStyle` describes where the notification comes from, whereas the `notificationAnimationOutStyle` describes where the notification will go.

The default value for `notificationAnimationInStyle` is `CWNotificationAnimationStyleTop`.

The default value for `notificationAnimationOutStyle` is `CWNotificationAnimationStyleTop`.

### Additional Remarks

The notifications will work in both screen orientations, however, screen rotation while a notification is displayed is not yet fully supported.
